# Classify-Clinical-Text

Project Objective: Classify Medical Transcriptions by subspecialty of medicine


I used the LSTM model to classify medical transcriptions. The whole procedure is in the notebook 'mt_classifier.ipynb'. The saved model weights are shared under the file 'lstm4_2.h5'.

The list of libraries required to run the notebook is in the 'requirement.txt' file.
